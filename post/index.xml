      <description>Since Nexus Food Delivery is still in the works, we&amp;rsquo;re currently in the process of acquiring partners. After all, without having partners, we won&amp;rsquo;t have any food to deliver!
Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on that, and we&amp;rsquo;re proud today to announce the arrival of 4 new partners. These restaurants have decided to partner up with Nexus Food Delivery and allow us to deliver their food to you, the fine people of Cookeville, TN.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the official blog of Nexus Food Delivery. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to get to know you all and start providing our services to the fine people of Cookeville, TN. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time in the making, but it still needs a bit longer in the fires of software development to be fully ready.
